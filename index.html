        <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <p>This is where I host my programming projects which have either been completed, or are actively in development working towards a completion state. You will find various projecs here, as my interests tend to be diverse. If you have any questions about these projects, feel free to contact me. Also, while this content is mine (unless otherwise stated), I am perfectly fine with people using it as long as they reference where they got it from.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to browse through my projects. I link to the completed ones in the "Completed" tab and post some sort of synopsis of currently active projects that aren't complete yet in the "Unfinished" tab. Since all of my projects are undertaken with the thought of learning whilst doing, I will list my learning objectives as I go along as well. </p>
		<p>If you're interested in a bit more about me, you can check out the "About Me" tab where I give a bit more information about my interests, skillset and background. Thanks for checking this portfolio out! </p>
