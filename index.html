        <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <p>This is where I host my programming projects which have either been completed, or are actively in development working towards a completion state. You will find various projecs here, as my interests tend to be diverse. If you have any questions about these projects, feel free to contact me. Also, while this content is mine (unless otherwise stated), I am perfectly fine with people using it as long as they reference where they got it from.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to browse through my projects. I link to the completed ones in the "Completed" tab and post some sort of synopsis of currently active projects that aren't complete yet in the "Unfinished" tab. Since all of my projects are undertaken with the thought of learning whilst doing, I will list my learning objectives as I go along as well. </p>
		<p>If you're interested in a bit more about me, you can check out the "About Me" tab where I give a bit more information about my interests, skillset and background. Thanks for checking this portfolio out! </p>

        <p>My name is Nick Axmaker and I'm a theoretical Mathematician, turned Math Educator. With a penchant for taking on projects of a technical nature for fun, my hobbies are wide ranging and include fields like software programming, small amounts of embedded systems, drones, mathematical proofs, system administration, open-source projects, and Linux development. I've dabbled in all of these things, with more time in certain of them than others. I read quite a bit, enjoying non-fiction about the World Wars (and most history honestly, specifically military history), as well as fiction ranging from sci-fi to fantasy to thrillers. </p>
		<p>I've been described as eclectic, and that is true. I value mechanical and technical features over fancy graphical interfaces, and so many of the games that I play and enjoy are text based or ASCII. I'm much more interested in something that is rules-complex than in something that is just really pretty. Logical thought is important to me, and solving puzzles, finding solutions to tricky problems, is something that I innately find enjoyable and will spend hours taking notes on a whiteboard, attempting to find a solution to something that is troubling me.</p>
