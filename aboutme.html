        <p>My name is Nick Axmaker and I'm a theoretical Mathematician, turned Math Educator. With a penchant for taking on projects of a technical nature for fun, my hobbies are wide ranging and include fields like software programming, small amounts of embedded systems, drones, mathematical proofs, system administration, open-source projects, and Linux development. I've dabbled in all of these things, with more time in certain of them than others. I read quite a bit, enjoying non-fiction about the World Wars (and most history honestly, specifically military history), as well as fiction ranging from sci-fi to fantasy to thrillers. </p>
		<p>I've been described as eclectic, and that is true. I value mechanical and technical features over fancy graphical interfaces, and so many of the games that I play and enjoy are text based or ASCII. I'm much more interested in something that is rules-complex than in something that is just really pretty. Logical thought is important to me, and solving puzzles, finding solutions to tricky problems, is something that I innately find enjoyable and will spend hours taking notes on a whiteboard, attempting to find a solution to something that is troubling me.</p>
